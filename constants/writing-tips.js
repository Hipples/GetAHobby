        title: "Don't be shy to try!",
        explanation: "Writing, like many other hobbies and skills such as math, can come across \
as intimidating with a great difficulty curve. And we would be lying if we pretended that \
becoming truly good at writing didn't require a lot of hard work and persistent practice. \
But so do all the most rewarding activities in life we might try! And like many of those \
things, you don't need to be a master of the craft to enjoy the journey. So don't be \
afraid to dive on in, get messy, get your hands dirty, and let your mind run free. So long \
as you're willing to be self-critical and always try to improve, it's the only way to get \
better and better in the first place."

        title: "It's not a competition",
        explanation: "One of the best ways to get better, and one of the most rewarding aspects of \
writing, is to have others read your work. First, they can be a critical extra pair of eyes, \
as someone who doesn't already know your work like you do can be more detached and \
independent in their reading. Second, while writing for yourself is always rewarding, a big \
part of any art is to share it with others, so that your expressions may be communicated to \
those who may share in the way you see and feel the world. Many writers, it seems especially \
in creative writing, seem to be reluctant to share with others, in particular other writers, \
for fear that they may try to steal their work, or that it will somehow lead to being put \
down by competitors. But even in a capitalistic world with scarce resources, the community \
of writers is very open and supportive. We're friends, not competitors. Don't keep yourself \
from the joys of community and fellowship! Share your work."

        title: "Try to develop good, disciplined habits...",
        explanation: "This is proactive advice from experience, as one of the most common frustrations \
among writers is a feeling of spinning their wheels in the mud. They don't think they're \
writing enough, things are moving too slowly, or they may feel outright stuck altogether, with \
a case of the infamous writer's block. The best solutions for these are pragmatic. Much of it \
is simply developing good, disciplined habits. There's no one size fits all approach, but for \
some ideas: Try to devote a half-hour to an hour each day to writing. In particular, make \
yourself write, even if you don't care for the results; you can always edit later. Treat your \
mind like a pipe of creativity, and work to keep it flowing. The more time you take off, the \
potentially more mental gunk and cobwebs may clog up the system. One famous writer even \
suggested not caring about what you write down at all. Just spend half an hour or fifteen \
minutes at least just writing stream of conscious, with perhaps a slight impetus towards the \
kind of thing you're generally aiming to write: like a particular genre or an academic topic \
for research. That would then be like a stretching and warming up before your main exercise. \
The important thing is that being a good writer and continuing to improve does take practice."

        title: "...But don't forget to have fun",
        explanation: "This is a hobby, not (necessarily) a job. And even if it is a job, you likely got \
started to have fun. Don't lose sight of that. Don't get so far down in the weeds that you get \
overwhelmed and miserable. The above advice about good habits was, as mentioned, for practical \
reasons: to mitigate some of the common causes of frustration. Don't let it dominate you. Take \
breaks. Do what's exciting to you. Don't be afraid to start up a random new side project just \
to get yourself happy and motivated again, because you always wanted to write a sci-fi space \
story, or you were really interested in doing a deep-dive a particular political or scientific \
topic but felt you just didn't have the time for it. Have fun. Always have fun."
