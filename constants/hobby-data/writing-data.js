export const description = "Writing is a fulfilling way to express your thoughts and illustrate concepts. It can be used to indulge in crazy fantasies or to make sense of the world around you. Most people only need a basic amount of training and practice to try one of the several forms of writing. \n\nCreative writing is the most common, as it is intensely personal, and it can manifest exciting tales and adventures. By exporing the fictional characters, we can grapple with our own humanity as lived in our social environments at an intimate level. It can be a way to explore philosophies and speculative ideas about the world or even the universe, with little to no restrictions from realism. \n\nThere is argumentative writing, which seeks to logically distill frequently adversarial concepts to advocate for a particular position. There is also academic writing, which tends to be more descriptively prosaic in nature. These can  often be combined, and are essentially the basis for column and blog writing in mass media. They may thus be used personally as well as professionally. \n\nFinally, we have technical writing, which is a subset of academic descriptive writing. Here, the focus is explaining the details, features, and use of a certain technology or platform. This last form of writing is most often used in corporate or industrial settings, but may be used in conjunction with hobbies like coding to express to the world the things you create.";

export const requirements = "Getting started with writing needs nothing more than a way to write down your thoughts - and to have some thoughts to write down! \n\nMaterials-wise, a computer is very common these days due to its convenience, since you can use spell checks, digital storage, and internet communication to increase your productivity and the reliability of keeping your work safe. There are more and more useful software tools such as Scrivener, which allows you to organize your work, such as scene by scene on a digital corkboard if you're writing a fiction novel. \n\nHowever, many people prefer more tactile and analog materials, such as pen and paper or a notebook, or in some cases even a typewriter. These indeed have a very satisfying feel to them. They can bring out the romance of writing in a way that a computer can't. They do come with additional difficulties, though. You will inevitably write slower with such materials. Even a typewriter frequently requires wrangling to get a desired result. Modern computers tend to Just Work. However, they are likely much cheaper than computers, with even a typewriter in the low hundreds of dollars; and a pen and paper much cheaper than that!";

export const healthAndSafety = "Be careful with sitting too long at a desk and staring at a screen. Too much physical inactivity - however much your mind may be at work - can contribute to health issues such as with your heart. \n\nEye strain may also result from staring at a computer screen if you choose to write in that medium, which is often more convenient if less relaxing than with tactile, analog materials like a notebook.";

        title: "Don't be shy to try!",
        explanation: "Writing, like many other hobbies and skills such as math, can come across as intimidating with a great difficulty curve. And we would be lying if we pretended that becoming truly good at writing didn't require a lot of hard work and persistent practice. But so do all the most rewarding activities in life we might try! And like many of those things, you don't need to be a master of the craft to enjoy the journey. So don't be afraid to dive on in, get messy, get your hands dirty, and let your mind run free. So long as you're willing to be self-critical and always try to improve, it's the only way to get better and better in the first place."

        index: 2,
        title: "It's not a competition",
        explanation: "One of the best ways to get better, and one of the most rewarding aspects of writing, is to have others read your work. First, they can be a critical extra pair of eyes, as someone who doesn't already know your work like you do can be more detached and independent in their reading. Second, while writing for yourself is always rewarding, a big part of any art is to share it with others, so that your expressions may be communicated to those who may share in the way you see and feel the world. Many writers, it seems especially in creative writing, seem to be reluctant to share with others, in particular other writers, for fear that they may try to steal their work, or that it will somehow lead to being put down by competitors. But even in a capitalistic world with scarce resources, the community of writers is very open and supportive. We're friends, not competitors. Don't keep yourself from the joys of community and fellowship! Share your work."

        title: "Try to develop good, disciplined habits...",
        explanation: "This is proactive advice from experience, as one of the most common frustrations among writers is a feeling of spinning their wheels in the mud. They don't think they're writing enough, things are moving too slowly, or they may feel outright stuck altogether, with a case of the infamous writer's block. The best solutions for these are pragmatic. Much of it is simply developing good, disciplined habits. There's no one size fits all approach, but for some ideas: Try to devote a half-hour to an hour each day to writing. In particular, make yourself write, even if you don't care for the results; you can always edit later. Treat your mind like a pipe of creativity, and work to keep it flowing. The more time you take off, the potentially more mental gunk and cobwebs may clog up the system. One famous writer even suggested not caring about what you write down at all. Just spend half an hour or fifteen minutes at least just writing stream of conscious, with perhaps a slight impetus towards the kind of thing you're generally aiming to write: like a particular genre or an academic topic for research. That would then be like a stretching and warming up before your main exercise. The important thing is that being a good writer and continuing to improve does take practice."

        title: "...But don't forget to have fun",
        explanation: "This is a hobby, not (necessarily) a job. And even if it is a job, you likely got started to have fun. Don't lose sight of that. Don't get so far down in the weeds that you get overwhelmed and miserable. The above advice about good habits was, as mentioned, for practical reasons: to mitigate some of the common causes of frustration. Don't let it dominate you. Take breaks. Do what's exciting to you. Don't be afraid to start up a random new side project just to get yourself happy and motivated again, because you always wanted to write a sci-fi space story, or you were really interested in doing a deep-dive into a particular political or scientific topic but felt you just didn't have the time for it. Whatever it is. Have fun. Always have fun."
