export const description = "Volleyball is a widely popular team sport played on a rectangular court divided evenly by a standing net. Two opposing teams, one on each side of the net, use primarily their hands to hit a spherical ball back and forth over an approximate 8 ft (2.4 m) net. The main types of volleyball are those played indoors on a hard floor, those played outside on grass, dirt, or other material, and those played outside on sand, what is commonly called beach volleyball. Because volleyball is an actively played sport, it helps to provide a healthy workout for all parts of the body.";

export const requirements = "Warming up before playing volleyball is critical so muscles can be best prepared for all of the physical activities involved in the game. Five or so minutes of light exercise will prepare the body for the physical actions found within volleyball. Stretching exercises are also recommended. However, stretching should be done after other exercises so muscles are not injured. After playing volleyball, spend another five minutes to cool down. Light exercises or walking helps to return the body to its resting state. Stretching afterward is also recommended. \n\nThese are the basic volleyball skills:\nBlock: The use of front-row players to jump up high in the air near the net with hands and arms held high in the air for the purpose of hitting a spiked ball back to the opposing team or detouring the spiked ball so a teammate can return it over the net \nDig: An underarm pass made with the forearms \nSet: A well-positioned ball placed high in the air and usually near the net for a teammate to hit with a strong overhead shot called a spike \nSpike: An aggressively hit ball that goes flying over the net at a high speed; it involves the player jumping very high and hitting the ball while it is high in the air \nTip: Also called a placement, a slightly hit ball that is deflected or dropped unexpectedly into the court of the opposing team";

export const healthAndSafety = "To play volleyball at the utmost level of competition, certain exercises should be performed. When performed on a regular basis, they will provide more agility, endurance, and strength while playing volleyball. These physical attributes are needed because volleyball players need 1. agility for quick reaction during fast-paced games; 2. endurance to maintain a high level of energy throughout games, and 3. strength for spiking, serving, and all of the other moves used in volleyball games. \n\nVolleyball is a highly competitive sport. Consequently, injuries will happen. Some of the more common injuries are sprains and strains, especially to the ankle. In addition, injuries to the hand and finger, knee, and shoulder also occur. When playing volleyball, the actions of attacking (hitting or spiking) cause the most injuries. Blocking injuries often result in injuries to the finger or ankle, while spiking injuries occur frequently to the shoulder, knee, and ankle.";
