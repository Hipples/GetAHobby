# GetAHobby

Mobile app hobby catalog. 

Have too much time on your hands? GetAHobby intends to help you solve that.

The key features of the app are design to motivate the user with new ideas about prospective hobbies. When the user starts the app, they are given the opportunity to create a basic profile with a name of their choosing. The home page simply greets them and prompts them with a random activity taken from the hobbies filled out by the team members. The user can then tap to randomly generate a new idea. In this way, they may be inspired by one of the prompts without digging further into the app.

If they do so, there is a tab for Explore Hobbies which will navigate them to a list of hobbies, again each one built out by each of the team members. While the details, including the above activities, are custom to the hobby, each page follows a similar format. An interesting image is displayed at the top along with a difficulty rating, from 1 to 5 stars representing Easy to Expert respectively, which the user can learn if they tap the small-i info icon next to it. Below that is: a description of the hobby; basic requireements for getting started, such as any logistical details to note; health and safety information as applicable; a set of tips which may be scrolled through by horizontally swiping; and external resources which are generally links to books and other websites, for example.

There is also a drawer menu which can be popped out from the left side. This menu can navigate to an About Us page, which gives a basic overview of our team and our project as per the CS 624 class, and a Settings page which allows the user to edit their name, delete their profile, or go back home.

This project was very enlightening as a practical experience developing an attractive, functional app implementing the various React Native concepts the team learned about in the course.
